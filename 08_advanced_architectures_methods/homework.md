I would be interested in using AI to learn from complex molecular dynamics (MD) data. Protein systems, for instance, have thousands of atoms, where MD keeps track of each of their motions. In practice, when eludicating things like free energy landscapes, one wants to reduce the dimensionality to a few collective variables (CV), but even then, understanding information about reactive transitions and rare transitions like  protein folding requires that one understands energy and kinetics landscapes in multiple dimensions. One task could be to collect MD samples for a protein and use metrics like the Kullback-Leibler divergence and maximum likelihood estimation to learn a "smooth" high-dimensional density estimate as a function of all CVs considered. This density can directly lead to free energy estimates, which can  then be used to update a bias potential whose role is to aid simulations in overcoming high energy barriers. Types of AI models that could be used are a normalizing flows and diffusion models.
